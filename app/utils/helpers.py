"""
Utility functions for the AI Escape Room game.
This module contains helper functions that can be shared across the application.
"""

# Currently, most utility functions are specific to their domains and have been
# moved to their respective modules:
# - Authentication utilities are in app/auth/auth.py
# - Database utilities are in app/database/connection.py  
# - Game utilities are in app/game/utils.py

# This module can be expanded in the future for general-purpose utilities
# that don't fit into specific domain modules.
